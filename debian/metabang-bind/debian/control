Description: Common Lisp flexible pattern matching
 Bind extends the idea of of let and destructing to provide a uniform syntax
 for all your accessor needs. It combines let, destructuring-bind,
 with-slots, with-accessors, structure editing, property or
 association-lists, and multiple-value-bind and a whole lot more into a
 single form.

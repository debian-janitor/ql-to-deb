Description: Collection of portable Common Lisp utilities
 alexandria is a collection of utilities in the public domain for Common Lisp
 .
 It is a library but also a project that aims to reduce duplication of effort
 and improve portability of Common Lisp code according to its own idiosyncratic 
 and rather conservative aesthetic.
 .
 It is used by other projects as a base to build on.

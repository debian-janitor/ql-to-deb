Description: Yet another Lisp markup language
 There are plenty of Lisp Markup Languages out there - every Lisp programmer
 seems to write at least one during his career - and CL-WHO (where WHO means
 "with-html-output" for want of a better acronym) is probably just as good
 or bad as the next one.

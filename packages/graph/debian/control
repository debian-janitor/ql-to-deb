Description: simple graph data structure and algorithms
 The GRAPH library strives for simplicity both in backing data structures
 and in usage. Graphs and Digraphs are represented as CLOS objects with
 methods and algorithms provided for graph manipulation and analysis.
 .
 See the GRAPH-JSON and GRAPH-DOT libraries for serialization and
 visualization of graphs.

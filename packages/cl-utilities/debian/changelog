cl-utilities (1.2.4-3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Bump the version number to avoid collisions with other versions
    of cl-utilities that were historically in the Debian archive before
    removal.
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt) so that the package can use an
    orig.tar.xz instead of orig.tar.gz, because the orig.tar.gz that was
    used when reintroduced also doesn't match the one previously in Debian,
    which violates one of the constraints that filenames are always unique
    in a package pool - which will cause problems for release archival
    down the line.
  * Closes: #805798.

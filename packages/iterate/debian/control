Description: Jonathan Amsterdam's Common Lisp iterator/gatherer/accumulator facility
 iterate is an iteration construct for Common Lisp. It is similar to the
 CL:LOOP macro, with these distinguishing marks:
 .
 it is extensible, it helps editors like Emacs indent iterate forms by
 having a more lisp-like syntax, and it isn't part of the ANSI standard for
 Common Lisp (which is sometimes a bad thing and sometimes good).

Package: cl-postmodern
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, cl-postgres, cl-s-sql, cl-closer-mop, cl-bordeaux-threads
Description: Common Lisp library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases
 Features efficient communication with the database server without need for
 foreign libraries, support for UTF-8 on Unicode-aware Lisp implementations,
 a syntax for mixing SQL and Lisp code, convenient support for prepared
 statements and stored procedures, a metaclass for simple database-access
 objects
 .
 The biggest differences between this library and CLSQL/CommonSQL are that
 Postmodern has no intention of being portable across different SQL
 implementations (it embraces non-standard Postgres features), and
 approaches extensions like lispy SQL and database access objects in a quite
 different way. This library was written because the CLSQL approach did not
 really work for me, your mileage may vary.

Package: cl-postgres
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, cl-usocket
Description: Low-level client library for PosgreSQL
 CL-postgres module implements a rather low-level interface for
 communicating with a PostgreSQL database server. It is part of the
 Postmodern library, but can be used separately.

Package: cl-s-sql
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: lispy syntax for SQL queries
 S-SQL provides a lispy syntax for SQL queries, and knows how to convert
 various lisp types to their textual SQL representation. It takes care to do
 as much of the work as possible at compile-time, so that at runtime a
 string concatenation is all that is needed to produce the final SQL query.

Package: cl-simple-date
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Common Lisp types for dates, timestamps, and intervals
 Simple-date provides types (CLOS classes) for dates, timestamps, and
 intervals similar to the ones SQL databases use, in order to be able to
 store and read these to and from a database in a straighforward way. A few
 obvious operations are defined on these types.
 .
 The most glaring defect of this library is its ignorance of time zones. It
 pretends the whole world lives in UTC. Use with care.
 .
 When this library is loaded after CL-postgres, it will register suitable SQL
 readers and writers for the associated database types.

Description: Common Lisp library providing easy csv reading and writing
 I had many scattered, not well tested, not easily runable pieces of csv
 code. I was unhappy with this situation then decided to refactor all of
 this into a single location. I wrote tests for it and had a library so I
 thought I might release it. This project started as extensions and bugfixes
 on arnesi's CSV.
 .
 I then looked around and saw there are other csv libs out there that
 probably mostly accomplished what I had set out to do. However, I already
 had code that was tested and had an easier license (BSD) so, I figured why
 not just release it anyway.

Description: Common Lisp set of utilities from Metabang
 Metatilities-base is the core of Metatilities. It has the good stuff that
 sits at the foundation of the rest of the code that metabang.com writes.
 .
 Metatilities is metabang.com's big box of stuff that has accumulated over
 the years. It's full of things you're pretty sure you don't need but can't
 quite bear to part with.

Description: JSON encoder/decoder for Common Lisp
 YASON is a Common Lisp library for encoding and decoding data in the JSON
 interchange format. JSON is used as a lightweight alternative to XML. YASON
 has the sole purpose of encoding and decoding data and does not impose any
 object model on the Common Lisp application that uses it.

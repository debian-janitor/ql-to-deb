Description: The Common Foreign Function Interface for Common Lisp
 CFFI, the Common Foreign Function Interface, purports to be a portable foreign
 function interface for Common Lisp. The CFFI library is composed of a
 Lisp-implementation-specific backend in the CFFI-SYS package, and a portable
 frontend in the CFFI package.
 .
 The CFFI-SYS backend package defines a low-level interface to the native FFI
 support in the Lisp implementation. It offers operators for allocating and
 dereferencing foreign memory, calling foreign functions, and loading shared
 libraries. The CFFI frontend provides a declarative interface for defining
 foreign functions, structures, typedefs, enumerated types. It is implemented
 in portable ANSI CL making use of the low-level operators exported by
 CFFI-SYS.
 .
 A UFFI compatibility layer is also being developed.
